   Then do M-y and it will be replaced by the first killed line.
   Do more M-y's and see what you get.  Keep doing them until

## GETTING MORE HELP

   C-h c	Display a very brief description of the command

   C-h f	Describe a function.  You type in the name of the
		function.


   C-h v	displays the documentation of variables,
       		including those whose values you can set to customize Emacs behavior.
		You need to type in the name of the variable when Emacs prompts for it.

   C-h a	Command Apropos.  Type in a keyword and Emacs will list
		all the commands whose names contain that keyword.
		These commands can all be invoked with META-x.
		For some commands, Command Apropos will also list a one
		or two character sequence which runs the same command.

   C-h i	Read included Manuals (a.k.a. Info).  This command puts
		you into a special buffer called "*info*" where you
		can read manuals for the packages installed on your system.
		Type m emacs <Return> to read the Emacs manual.
		If you have never before used Info, type ? and Emacs
		will take you on a guided tour of Info mode facilities.
		Once you are through with this tutorial, you should
		consult the Emacs Info manual as your primary documentation.
